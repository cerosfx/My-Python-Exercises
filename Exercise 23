# practice for loops and range()

# Use a for loop to print number from 1 to 20

for value in range(1, 21):
	print(value)

# Make a list of number 1 to 1 million and use a for loop to print numbers.

numbers = list(range(1, 1000001))
for value in numbers:
	print(value)
print(min(numbers))
print(max(numbers))
print(sum(numbers))

# Use range to make a list of odd numbers from 1 to 20. Use a for loop to print it.

odd_numbers = list(range(1, 21, 2))
for value in odd_numbers:
	print(value)
print("\n")

# Make a list of multiples of 3 from 3 to 30. Use a for loop to print the numbers on the list.

multiples = list(range(3, 31, 3))
for value in multiples:
	print(value)
print("\n")

# Make a list of the first 10 cubes from 1 to 10 and use a for loop to print list.

cubes = list(range(1, 11))
for value in cubes:
	num_cube = (value**3)
	print(num_cube)

# make the same list in comprehensive

cubes = [ value**3 for value in range(1, 11)]
print(cubes)
